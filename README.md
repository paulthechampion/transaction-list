This App was built by Nkechukwu Paul Enwerem for a Coding Assignment

Assignment Question :
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every
dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for
each customer per month and total.



I built this App using create-react-app, You add your transactions youself its quick and easy to understand. I originally wanted to make this App a full stack app, bu=y having a backend folder and using "express" to create an API and mongodb to create a database schema so I can send data to the front end and reciceve using react and redux but decided to store all my date in localhost for the purpose of this assignment

I have a file called transactonList in my assest folder where I create the transcation class and some methods needed to complete this assignmenet in the class

My work is pretty straight forward and understandable and I hope you take out your time to understand and appreciate my efforts 

I am deploying this app with heroku so the devs that test this can easily run, open and test the app without any issues 


I hope you have fun as you use this app and appreciate my efforts!!!
